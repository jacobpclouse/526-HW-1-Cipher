\section{\underline{ - Question 1a Answer:}}
For my First name: J A C O B, I found that the combine total is 9 + 0 + 2 + 14 + 1. (9 + 0 + 2 + 14 + 1) is equal to 26, so we use (26) mod 26 which is equal to 0. So in C1 = (a * P1 + b) mod 26, C1 is equal to 0 (for the most common letter E). E is normally valued at 4 in plaintext. \newline


For my Last name: C L O U S E, I found that the combine total is 2 + 11 + 14 + 20 + 18 + 4. (2 + 11 + 14 + 20 + 18 + 4) is equal to 69, so we use (69) mod 26 which is equal to 17. So in C2 = (a * P2 + b) mod 26, C2 is equal to 17 (for the second most common letter T). T is normally valued at 19 in plaintext. \newline

Here are the equations: \newline
E / First name: \textbf{C1 = (a * P1 + b) mod 26} \textit{OR} \textbf{4 = (a * 0 + b) mod 26} \newline
T / Last name:  \textbf{C2 = (a * P2 + b) mod 26} \textit{OR} \textbf{4 = (a * 0 + b) mod 26} \newline


To find the difference between the two we can subtract the first from the second:

\begin{math}
	17 = (a * 19 + b)  mod  26
	0 = (a *  4 + b)   mod  26
	--
	17 = 15a  mod  26	
\end{math}
