# 526-HW-1-Cipher
My own cryptographic cipher based off of the 1st homework issued - 526 Cryptography - Spring 2023


## Objectives for this Homework:
Design and implement your own (new) encryption scheme that uses the three operations widely used in classical cryptography: *Substitution*, *Transposition* and *Product*. 

Provide a description of your algorithm and justify the choice of steps and operations used in the algorithm. 
[3+2 = 5 points]

In addition, show that:
- * (a) breaking your algorithm is going to require coding effort (i.e., your algorithm cannot be broken by using pen and paper). [1.5 points]

- * (b) your algorithm is secure against any two cryptanalytic attacks. [1.5 points]
